Farmer manager
==============
Spawn farmers in Start()
- random position on map until it finds empty spot (not blocked by rocks)
Update farmers in Update()
- Farmer.Tick()
- render farmers
- moveSmooth = 1f - Mathf.Pow(movementSmooth, Time.deltaTime)


Farmer
======
PickIntension
- reset path, choose randomly: SmashRocks, TillGround, PlantSeeds, SellPlants
SmashRocks
- find rock within range of 20 steps (A* lookup by reachability)
- attack rock, until it's dead
TillGround
PlantSeeds
SellPlants
FollowPath
- move along path, pop reached positions
- walk around plants (walk on tile border, not center)
Movement
- smoothPosition = Vector3.Lerp(smoothPosition, position, moveSmooth);
Attacking rock
- random shake
    float rand = Random.value * .5f;
    xOffset = (path.xPositions[0] + .5f - smoothPosition.x) * rand;
    zOffset = (path.yPositions[0] + .5f - smoothPosition.y) * rand;
